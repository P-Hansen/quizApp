Core Work -

Create quizzes
- users can make the quiz unlisted
- Try to make the create quiz path today and log the query into the database
- query to boolean for listed/unlisted on homepage
- fix "name" on ejs of created quiz for answers, each answer needs to be referenced from req.body as different "answers" to insert into database correctly

Home Page
- users can see a list of public quizzes

Results Page
- users can see a result of the recent attempt
- users can share a result to the recent attempt


- Can make quiz public or private, but we can put DEFAULT TRUE to public on the schema and if they check private in the create page, return that value as FALSE

- Trying to get the url path after logging in to match something like  /:user_id
	cookie storing user id

Logout button needs to post and clear cookies

Stretch Work -

add functionality for search bar to search for categories of quizzes?
see if we can get the quiz api to pull into the database
	- if not, hardcode quizzes into database ourselves
created category field in create quiz page, and possibly make default of category "user_created" if no category is specified
